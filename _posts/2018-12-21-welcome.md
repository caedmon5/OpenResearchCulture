Welcome to *Future Commons: The Partnership for Open Research Culture.*

We are a new Research and Mobilization Observatory and Partnership dedicated to the study and promotion of Open Research Practice by individual researchers. 

*Future Commons* is led by an international team of researchers and information professionals that includes some of the most prominent thought-leaders in the Open Access/Open Science movements. Our partner and prospective partner institutions include Libraries and Universities from five continents as well as scholarly societies and consortia dedicated to the mobilisation of Open Research Practices.

We are in the process of preparing an application to the [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada)](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/) [2019 Partnership Grant Competition](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/about-au_sujet/partnerships-partenariats/partnership_grants-bourses_partenariats-eng.aspx).

You can read more about *Future Commons* by downloading [Executive Summary](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2487657) (also available under the (../about.md) tab). If you are interested in joining *Future Commons* as either an institutional partner or an individual researcher, please contact the project director, [Professor Daniel Paul O'Donnell](mailto:daniel.odonnell@uleth.ca).
